  We are making a Web App that will help Local Breweries Add and take away breweriesthat they Own. The Brew Master will also be able to edit in the Special Seasonal Beers and Regulars that leave. MVP
  
  We would like to make this into a communication WebApp for Brew Masters for Creativity and Local Brewery Community. Then we would then like to turn to a full fledge App for People to use when they go to a Great Local Brewery City.
  
  We Connected the Front and Back End Friday 12/14/2018. We did have some issues with Github and commits, but we worked out the kinks.
  
  Over the weekend we worked on the Brewery Master making a profile, adding breweries, editing beers, logo, slide show.
 
 Today 12/17/2018 we are working on refining the Front and Back End, making people want to use our WebApp. We are now able to edit the breweries.
